	</a>
	<b>Levels</b>
</h3>

The game currently consists of 10 default levels with progressive difficulty.

One additional bonus level (Level 11) can be played by beating all 10 default levels without getting destroyed once (good luck).

New levels can be added incredibly easy by adding to the `Levels.jack` file.
Simply add an if-statement to the `tankAmount`-function which returns the amount of tanks on the new level-map.
Define your level inside the `initLevel`-function by providing a new if-statement containing the height-values to design the map and add tanks to any position. The first tank in the alltanks-array will always be the player tank.

	</a>
	<b>Highscore</b>
</h3>

For every point of damage you deal to an enemy tank your score will increment by 1.
For example a hit with a medium shot (dealing 40 damage) will increase your score by 40.
A direct hit (not hitting the ground directly next to an enemy) will multiply the added score with the factor 1,3.
For example a direct hit with a medium shot will not increment the score by 40, but 40 multiplied by 1,3, therefor increasing the score by 52 points.

Additionally you will get bonus points after each level if you clear a level with fewer shots.
If a level has 1 enemy, you will get bonus points if you need less than 4 shots (for 2 enemies less than 8 shots and so on).
If a level has 3 enemies (you need less than 12 shots) and you clear the level with only 9 shots the difference (12-9 = 3) will be multiplied by 15 (3*15 = 45) and added to the score.

	</a>
	<b>Cheating</b>
</h3>

If you wish to play through all levels without fearing for death, the easiest way to cheat invulnerability is to change the `applyDamage`-function within the `Tank.jack`-file by changing the statement `if (destroyed) { return; }` to `if (destroyed | playerTank) { return; }`. (This of course is for developing and testing purposes only üòè).

You can also change the first `let level = 1;` line within the `Main.jack` file to start the game at a certain level.

(Cheating ain't difficult if you have the source code ... Don't be a B*tch üôÉ).
